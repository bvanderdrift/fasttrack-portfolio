*Published on June 15, 2023 â€¢ 3 min read*

Welcome to my blog! As a product engineer with experience in fast-moving startups, I've learned a lot about building user-centric products efficiently.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted to share my experiences and insights with fellow engineers and anyone interested in product development. Writing is a great way to organize thoughts and contribute to the community.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be covering:

- Technical insights from my projects
- Best practices in product engineering
- Reflections on working in startups
- Cool technologies I'm exploring

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

\`\`\`jsx
const Welcome = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my blog</p>
    </div>
  );
};
\`\`\`

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
    `;
  }
  
  return `# ${getPostBySlug(slug)?.title || "Post Not Found"}

*This content would be loaded from a markdown file in a real implementation.*

This is placeholder content for the ${slug} post.
  `;
};

// Function to calculate estimated reading time from markdown content
export const calculateReadingTime = (content: string): string => {
  const wordsPerMinute = 200;
  const wordCount = content.trim().split(/\s+/).length;
  const readingTime = Math.ceil(wordCount / wordsPerMinute);
  
  return `${readingTime} min read`;
};
