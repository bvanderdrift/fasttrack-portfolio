# Hello World: My First Blog Post

*Published on June 15, 2023 â€¢ 3 min read*

Welcome to my blog! As a product engineer with experience in fast-moving startups, I've learned a lot about building user-centric products efficiently.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted to share my experiences and insights with fellow engineers and anyone interested in product development. Writing is a great way to organize thoughts and contribute to the community.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be covering:

- Technical insights from my projects
- Best practices in product engineering
- Reflections on working in startups
- Cool technologies I'm exploring

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
const Welcome = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my blog</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
